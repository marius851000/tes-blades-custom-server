"""
Utility to resolve Unity‑style reference dictionaries.

In Unity exported assets the *source* reference is stored under a ``$ref`` key.
The *target* asset that defines the reference contains a ``$id`` key and an
``_id`` field that uniquely identifies the asset.  This helper scans the
entire data structure for all such target objects and replaces any
reference that contains a ``$ref`` key but no ``_id`` with the fully
defined target dictionary.

The function operates on a single parsed asset (a mapping) and returns
a new mapping with all references resolved.  It does not modify the
original input.
